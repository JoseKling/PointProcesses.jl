# Roadmap

Here is a list of features that are yet to be implemented...

## Soon

- Compatibility with reverse-mode AD (Zygote.jl)
- Hawkes processes
- Cox processes
- Markov-Modulated Poisson Processes
- Prediction and evaluation utilities

## Someday

- Poisson processes on arbitrary measured spaces
- Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Processes
- Gaussian Process-modulated Poisson Processes

## Maybe not

- Neural point processes?
- Interface with MLJ.jl?
- Interface with Turing.jl?
